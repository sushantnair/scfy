Soft Computing For You is a collection of pages - one for each learning rule - where each page has a description of the learning rule, as well as a Code section where different tabs can display Code written in different languages (like Python, Java, C, C++, etc.) to implement that Learning Rule. The code can be copied, edited and run so that the users may see live output and have better understanding of the Learning Rule. Below the code section, there is a "Contribute" button. If a logged-in user clicks on it, then the user is prompted to enter alternative code which would be an improvement over the existing code displayed. If the code is good, the website admin would accept it and the featured code displayed in the Code Section would be that contributed code. Also, in the user's dashboard, there would be a mention of this achievement of the user.
