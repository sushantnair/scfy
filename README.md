Soft Computing For You is a collection of pages - one for each learning rule - where each page has a description of the learning rule, as well as a Code section where different tabs can display Code written in different languages (like Python, Java, C, C++, etc.) to implement that Learning Rule. The code can be copied, edited and run so that the users may see live output and have better understanding of the Learning Rule. Below the code section, there is a "Contribute" button. If a logged-in user clicks on it, then the user is prompted to enter alternative code which would be an improvement over the existing code displayed. If the code is good, the website admin would accept it and the featured code displayed in the Code Section would be that contributed code. Also, in the user's dashboard, there would be a mention of this achievement of the user. 

Objective: The objective of "Soft Computing For You" is to revolutionize the learning experience in Soft Computing by:
a) Providing an interactive platform: Create a user-friendly interface that allows learners to experiment with and execute code examples for each learning rule.
b) Facilitating user contributions: Enable registered users to suggest alternative code implementations, fostering a collaborative learning community.
c) Implementing a secure authentication system: Ensure user data and contributions are protected through robust authentication and authorization protocols.
d) Verifying code contributions: Establish a process to review and validate user-submitted code for accuracy and relevance before integration.
e) Tracking user achievements: Maintain a transparent record of user contributions, reflecting their accomplishments in their personal dashboard.
"Soft Computing For You" aims to offer a dynamic and inclusive platform for learners to gain a deeper understanding of Soft Computing principles while actively participating in its development.
