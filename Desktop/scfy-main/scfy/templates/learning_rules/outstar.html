            The Outstar Learning Rule is a concept primarily associated with competitive neural networks, which are a class of artificial neural networks designed to model the competitive interactions and self-organizing properties observed in biological neural systems. This learning rule, sometimes referred to as the "winner-takes-all" rule, plays a pivotal role in training competitive networks, allowing them to develop a representation of input patterns based on competition among their neurons.

            <br>
            In competitive neural networks, the goal is to identify the most relevant or salient input pattern among a group of competing neurons. The Outstar Learning Rule is used to adjust the weights of the output neurons in such a way that the neuron with the highest activation or response to a given input becomes the "winner" and is responsible for representing that input pattern. The weights to the winning neuron are modified to improve its response to similar inputs in the future.

            <br>
            This learning rule reflects the concept of competitive learning, where neurons compete to respond to specific input patterns, and only the strongest neuron is allowed to represent the input. The Outstar Learning Rule is particularly useful in scenarios where unsupervised learning is required, and the network needs to discover the underlying structure or clusters within the input data. While competitive networks are not as commonly used as other neural network architectures like feedforward or recurrent networks, the Outstar Learning Rule provides a valuable framework for tasks such as clustering, feature extraction, and pattern recognition, where competition among neurons is a central organizing principle.

        <code>
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.linear_model import Outstar
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, n_features=2, centers=2, random_state=0)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Outstar classifier
clf = Outstar(max_iter=100, random_state=0)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).mean()
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

# Plot the data points and decision boundary
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.Paired)
ax = plt.gca()
xlim = ax.get_xlim()
ylim = ax.get_ylim()
xx, yy = plt.meshgrid(
    np.linspace(xlim[0], xlim[1], 50),
    np.linspace(ylim[0], ylim[1], 50)
)
Z = clf.decision_function(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
plt.contour(xx, yy, Z, colors='k', levels=[0], linestyles=['-'])
plt.title('Outstar Decision Boundary')
plt.show()
